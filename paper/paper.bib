abstract = {Mathematical modeling to understand battery performance has a history of more than 50 years. The essence of modeling is to make predictions, as is the case across all scientific disciplines; indeed, we can think of models as hypotheses or theories to be tested against experimental data. Models allow us to interpolate between and extrapolate from points in data; without them, a new experiment would need to be run for every use case of a battery.}

journal = {Progress in Energy},
abstract = {Physics-based electrochemical battery models derived from porous electrode theory are a very powerful tool for understanding lithium-ion batteries, as well as for improving their design and management. Different model fidelity, and thus model complexity, is needed for different applications. For example, in battery design we can afford longer computational times and the use of powerful computers, while for real-time battery control (e.g. in electric vehicles) we need to perform very fast calculations using simple devices. For this reason, simplified models that retain most of the features at a lower computational cost are widely used. Even though in the literature we often find these simplified models posed independently, leading to inconsistencies between models, they can actually be derived from more complicated models using a unified and systematic framework. In this review, we showcase this reductive framework, starting from a high-fidelity microscale model and reducing it all the way down to the single particle model, deriving in the process other common models, such as the Doyle–Fuller–Newman model. We also provide a critical discussion on the advantages and shortcomings of each of the models, which can aid model selection for a particular application. Finally, we provide an overview of possible extensions to the models, with a special focus on thermal models. Any of these extensions could be incorporated into the microscale model and the reductive framework re-applied to lead to a new generation of simplified, multi-physics models.

abstract = {Li-ion batteries are a key enabling technology for electric vehicles and determining their properties precisely is an essential step in improving utilization and performance. Batteries are highly complex electrochemical systems, with processes occurring in parallel on many time- and length-scales. Models describing these mechanisms require extensive parametrization efforts, conventionally using a combination of ex-situ characterization and systems identification. We present a methodology that algorithmically designs current input signals to optimize parameter identifiability from voltage measurements. Our approach uses global sensitivity analysis based on the generalized polynomial chaos expansion to map the entire parameter uncertainty space, relying on minimal prior knowledge of the system. Parameter specific optimal experiments are designed to maximize sensitivity and simultaneously minimize interactions and unwanted contributions by other parameters. Experiments are defined using only three design variables making our approach computationally efficient. The methodology is demonstrated using the Doyle-Fuller-Newman battery model for eight parameters of a 2.6 Ah 18,650 cell. Validation confirms that the proposed approach significantly improves model performance and parameter accuracy, while lowering experimental burden.}

abstract = {Physics-based battery models are important tools in battery research, development, and control. To obtain useful information from the models, accurate parametrization is essential. A complex model structure and many unknown and hard-to-measure parameters make parametrization challenging. Furthermore, numerous applications require non-invasive parametrization relying on parameter estimation from measurements of current and voltage. Parametrization of physics-based battery models from input–output data is a growing research area with many recent publications. This paper aims to bridge the gap between researchers from different fields that work with battery model parametrization, since successful parametrization requires both knowledge of the underlying physical system as well as understanding of theory and concepts behind parameter estimation. The review encompasses sensitivity analyses, methods for parameter optimization, structural and practical identifiability analyses, design of experiments and methods for validation as well as the use of machine learning in parametrization. We highlight that not all model parameters can accurately be identified nor are all relevant for model performance. Nonetheless, no consensus on parameter importance could be shown. Local methods are commonly chosen because of their computational advantages. However, we find that the implications of local methods for analysis of non-linear models are often not sufficiently considered in reviewed literature.}

abstract = {Electrochemical models are more and more widely applied in battery diagnostics, prognostics and fast charging control, considering their high fidelity, high extrapolability and physical interpretability. However, parameter identification of electrochemical models is challenging due to the complicated model structure and a large number of physical parameters with different identifiability. The scope of this work is the development of a data-driven parameter identification framework for electrochemical models for lithium-ion batteries in real-world operations with artificial intelligence, i.e., the cuckoo search algorithm. Only current and voltage data are used as input for the multi-objective global optimization of the parameters considering both voltage error between the model and the battery and the relative capacity error between two electrodes. The multi-step identification process based on sensitivity analysis increases the identification accuracy of the parameters with low sensitivity. Moreover, the novel identification process inspired by the training process in machine learning further overcomes the overfitting problem using limited battery data. The data-driven approach achieves a maximum root mean square error of 9 mV and 12.7 mV for the full cell voltage under constant current discharging and real-world driving cycles, respectively, which is only 17.9% and 42.9% of that of the experimental identification approach.}

abstract = {Porous electrode theory (PET) is widely used to model battery dynamics by describing electrochemical kinetics and transport in solid particles and electrolyte. Standard PET models rely on black-box descriptions of the thermodynamics of active materials, typically obtained by fitting an open-circuit potential which does not allow for a consistent description of phase-separating materials. Multiphase PET (MPET) was recently developed to describe batteries using white- or gray-box descriptions of the thermodynamics with additional parameters that need to be estimated from experimental data. This work analyzes the identifiability of parameters in the MPET model, including the standard kinetics and diffusion parameters, as well as MPET-specific parameters for the free energy of active materials. Based on synthetic discharge data, both linearized and nonlinear identifiability analyses are performed for an MPET model of a commercial Lithium Iron Phosphate/Graphite battery, which identify which model parameters are not identifiable and which are identifiable only with large uncertainty. The identifiable parameters control phase separation, reaction kinetics, and electrolyte transport, but not solid diffusion, consistent with rate limitation by intercalation reactions at low rates and by electrolyte diffusion at high rates. The article also proposes approaches for reducing parameter identifiability issues.}

journal = {Journal of The Electrochemical Society},
abstract = {Porous electrode theory (PET) is widely used to model battery cycling behavior by describing electrochemical kinetics and transport in solid particles and electrolyte, and modeling thermodynamics by fitting an open-circuit potential. The PET model consists of tightly coupled nonlinear partial differential-algebraic equations in which effective kinetic and transport parameters are fit to battery cycling data, and then the model is used to analyze the effects of variations in design parameters or operating conditions such as charging protocols. In a detailed nonlinear identifiability analysis, we show that most of the effective model parameters in porous electrode theory are not practically identifiable from cycling data for a lithium-ion battery. The only identifiable parameter that can be identified from C/10 discharge data is the effective solid diffusion coefficient, indicating that this battery is in the diffusion-limited regime at this discharge rate. A resistance in series correlation was shown for the practically unidentifiable parameters by mapping out the confidence region. Alternative experiments in addition to discharge cycles are required in order to uniquely determine the full set of parameters.}

abstract = {This paper presents a Bayesian parameter estimation approach and identifiability analysis for a lithium-ion battery model, to determine the uniqueness, evaluate the sensitivity and quantify the uncertainty of a subset of the model parameters. The analysis was based on the single particle model with electrolyte dynamics, rigorously derived from the Doyle-Fuller-Newman model using asymptotic analysis including electrode-average terms. The Bayesian approach allows complex target distributions to be estimated, which enables a global analysis of the parameter space. The analysis focuses on the identification problem (i) locally, under a set of discrete quasi-steady states of charge, and in comparison (ii) globally with a continuous excursion of state of charge. The performance of the methodology was evaluated using synthetic data from multiple numerical simulations under diverse types of current excitation. We show that various diffusivities as well as the transference number may be estimated with small variances in the global case, but with much larger uncertainty in the local estimation case. This also has significant implications for estimation where parameters might vary as a function of state of charge or other latent variables.}
