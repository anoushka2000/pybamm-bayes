abstract = {Mathematical modeling to understand battery performance has a history of more than 50 years. The essence of modeling is to make predictions, as is the case across all scientific disciplines; indeed, we can think of models as hypotheses or theories to be tested against experimental data. Models allow us to interpolate between and extrapolate from points in data; without them, a new experiment would need to be run for every use case of a battery.}

title = {A continuum of physics-based lithium-ion battery models reviewed},
journal = {Progress in Energy},
abstract = {Physics-based electrochemical battery models derived from porous electrode theory are a very powerful tool for understanding lithium-ion batteries, as well as for improving their design and management. Different model fidelity, and thus model complexity, is needed for different applications. For example, in battery design we can afford longer computational times and the use of powerful computers, while for real-time battery control (e.g. in electric vehicles) we need to perform very fast calculations using simple devices. For this reason, simplified models that retain most of the features at a lower computational cost are widely used. Even though in the literature we often find these simplified models posed independently, leading to inconsistencies between models, they can actually be derived from more complicated models using a unified and systematic framework. In this review, we showcase this reductive framework, starting from a high-fidelity microscale model and reducing it all the way down to the single particle model, deriving in the process other common models, such as the Doyle–Fuller–Newman model. We also provide a critical discussion on the advantages and shortcomings of each of the models, which can aid model selection for a particular application. Finally, we provide an overview of possible extensions to the models, with a special focus on thermal models. Any of these extensions could be incorporated into the microscale model and the reductive framework re-applied to lead to a new generation of simplified, multi-physics models.
